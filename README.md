# Too-Precise-Countdown

Very basic countdown using javascript with ~~too~~ high precision.

### Q&A

**Is this precise to the nanoseconds ?**

lol nope it's not even precise to the milliseconds.
the precision is limited by how precise javascript is able to get the current time (to the second) and how long it take for your browser to execute the javascript of the page.

you could expect this counter to be precise to a 10th of a second.

**then what is the point of this ?**

It look cool I guess `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

**Can I use this ?**

yup use it as you want.

a link to this repo has credit would be nice.
